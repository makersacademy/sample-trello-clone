A simple cards-based kanban board web app heavily inspired by Trello, the UI is also pretty similar to that of Trello. You can create up to 512 unique kanban boards with different names, which holds cards. Each card can hold an unlimited number of items/tasks each. All items support drag and drop between cards as well as within the same card to reoder. All data is stored locally on the computer by the browser. This whole project was written by [waterrmalann](https://github.com/waterrmalann) in HTML, CSS, and pure vanilla JavaScript with no external dependencies.
